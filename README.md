# Job application materials
This repo contains the 'generic' versions of my application materials for academic (specifically, assisant professor) ecology-type jobs in the 2016-2017 application season. The materials are generally targetted at research institutions with doctoral programs. This was ultimately my sucessful application season, so the materials can't be too far off of search committee expectations for jobs in this field.

 I hope they provide helpful examples for future job seekers.
