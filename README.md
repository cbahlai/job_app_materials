# Job application materials
This repo contains the 'generic' versions of my application materials for academic ecology-type jobs in the 2016-2017 application season. This was ultimately my sucessful application season, so the materials can't be too far off of search committee expectaions for jobs in this field.

 I hope they provide helpful examples for future job seekers.
